# WorkEase-App
I developed an app to hire skilled craftsmen with fixed hourly rates and additional services. It provides job opportunities for underserved communities, supporting fair employment. Users can find trusted professionals like carpenters, electricians, and plumbers, with transparent pricing and reliable service, bridging gaps in access to quality work.
